# Rapid

Rapid is a pattern library for creating 'live wireframes' and prototypes. It's a collection of pre-built HTML/CSS components that you can drag and drop into your text editor. 

### Framework-agnostic

The components are framework-agnostic, so you can use which ever grid framework you want. Set your grids up with Bootstrap or Inuit, then get wireframing with Rapid. 

### BEM and SASS

Rapid uses SASS and the BEM class naming convention to bring hardcore maintainability and modularity to your projects. 

### BONUS client content-entry _before_ design begins

Integrate your Rapid pages with your CMS of choice so that you can get your clients started on content entry at a good, early stage. Getting our clients thinking and working on content at this early stage means the site's structure and messaging requirements as much more defined at the start of the design phase.
